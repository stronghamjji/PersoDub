// Every IPC channel has three halves that must agree: the preload exposes it,
// the main process answers it (or announces on it), and the page uses it. A

// nothing handles leaves the page's promise waiting forever, an announcement
// nobody listens for just disappears -- so this reads all three and fails on
// any channel that is not wired the whole way through.
